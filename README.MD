# Neighborhood Map Project
## Front End Web Development Nano-Degree

# Note to All Future Udacians:
1)Yes , Its a tough one.

2) Try HARD ! !. HardWork never Fails.! (*Sometimes though!*)


##How To

1)Download the Zip File and extract the zip in a Folder in your computer (Tough Part ;p)

2)Open index.html to view the Site


##General Info:

Using html, css, jquery and knockoutJS library . Made a Map of my city Madurai and its famous places surrounded in my Neighborhood with Google and Wikipedia API. I thank Google and Wikipedia for letting me use their API.

##Work Done

Included the Google API and a Media API  with a valid license key to incorporate the Google Map and Wikipedia links

Data requests that fail are handled **gracefully**(Lol!) using common fallback techniques through the browser's Alert window.

Have included option with search and Filter options

7 exotic(jus kidding! :p ) places in Madurai with the image and Wikipedia Information

Included NavBar for the Tab and mobile phones.(Worst NavBar of All.. Will change it soon !)

Added the Google Marker with Bounce Animation and Labeling the Marker with numbers.(Google saves the day)


Map Size is reduced intentionally to provide space for HamMenu *Devs out there Suggest a Better Solutions*

JS,HTML,CSS are beautified and minified using online tools(Google Helps!)

Images are compressed and converted into png using online converter and compressor(Once again saved by Google!)

###Sites used for Compression:

1)Optimizilla (*Multiple file Upload feature is awesome !*)

2)Jpg2Png
